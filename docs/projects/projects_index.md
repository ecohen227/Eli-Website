# Projects

Here are some projects that I am/was working on. 

- [Optimal Filter Derivation](./OF/OF.md) is a presentation discussing the optimal filtering algorithm currently used in ATLAS' liquid argon calorimeter. I created this document to help clarify terminology used within my project as there are many different notations and synonymous derivations used to describe these filters. **Consider this my blog post about a research concept for PHYS 610**

- [Beamforming for Sonar Signals](./python_project/python_project.ipynb) is a project I am working on for my course in digital signal processing (McGill ECSE 512). This project focuses on applying, comparing, and contrasting beamforming techniques, which are essential in enhancing signal directionality and reducing noise interference in sonar systems.

- [GWSkyNetLite: A Gravitational Wave Glitch Classifier Using High Speed Localization Skymaps](./thesis/thesis.md) was my honours thesis (PHYS 449). This project focused on developing a real-time gravitational wave classifier to seperate glitched data from real gravitational wave events. By using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques I developed a convolutional neural network that was able to use low-latency skymaps to classify data in record time. I also investigated the interpretability of the model using various techniques in order to garner trust in the models predictions.

- [Constraining Cosmic String Parameters Via Gravitational Waves](./poster/poster.md) was a project for my course in cosmology (UBC ASTR 403). This project was the creation of a poster documenting how data collected by the LIGO-Virgo array could put limits on early universe formation of cosmic strings. For this project I was awarded 3rd place in the class out of 30 posters.

- [An Investigation into Mercury and Electron Behaviour Via the Franck Hertz Experiment](./FH/FH.md) was a project for my upper level experimental labratory (UBC PHYS 409). This project involved recreating the Franck-Hertz experiment which involved accelerating electrons through a thin mercury vapour. By observing the resulting current conclusions were drawn about the quantization of mercury's energy levels. The uncertainties in this experiment were calculated by using a toy Monte-Carlo model.
