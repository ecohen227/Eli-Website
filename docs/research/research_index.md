# Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of digital signal processing, machine learning, and statistical modeling, where I explore advanced methods to analyze and interpret complex data sets. I focus mainly on developing algorithms and methodologies for real-time implementation.

I currently have no publications, but I'm working on it!

## Recent Highlights

Coming soon!
