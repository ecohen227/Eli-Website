Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! Iâ€™m a physics graduate student at McGill with a passion for all things computational physics. I specialize in developing event-detection algorithms and exploring simulation-based research. Throughout my journey, I've had the unique opportunity to contribute to projects across distinct fields: from analyzing oil pipeline integrity with Grey Owl Engineering, to delving into the mysteries of gravitational waves with the LIGO collaboration. I am currently investigating high-energy particle physics in collaboration with CERN.
