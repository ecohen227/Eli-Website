# Introduction

I am an aspiring computational physicist who is currently pursuing a Master's degree in high energy experimental particle physics at McGill University. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree in honours physics with distinction from UBC. During my undergraduate degree I completed my thesis with the UBC LIGO group. This worked centered around developing GWSkyNetLite, an extension of the GWSkyNet[1] algorithm designed to separate glitches from genuine gravitational wave events in low-latency settings using rapidly generated skymaps. An additional focus of the work was improving the interpretability of gravitational wave classifiers by researching and implementing methods that probed the patterns and concepts the model used to classify data.

Currently, I am working with the ATLAS group at McGill to develop energy reconstruction algorithms for use in ATLAS' liquid argon calorimeter. This work combines digital signal processing and experimental physics to ensure real-time accuracy and resolution is maintained through the LHC's upgrade.

Outside of academics, I am deeply passionate about [science outreach](./outreach.md) and communication. As a volunteer with McGill's Physics and Astronomy Outreach program, I have disseminated complex scientific topics to members of the public, making them accessible and exciting for everyone.
