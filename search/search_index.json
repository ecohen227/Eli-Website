I\u2019m a physics graduate student at McGill with a passion for all things computational physics. I specialize in developing event-detection algorithms and exploring simulation-based research. Throughout my journey, I've had the unique opportunity to contribute to projects across distinct fields: from analyzing oil pipeline integrity with Grey Owl Engineering, to delving into the mysteries of gravitational waves with the LIGO collaboration. I am currently investigating high-energy particle physics in collaboration with CERN.</p> <p>Explore my projects, research interests, and more about me!</p>"},{"location":"about/about_index/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>I am an aspiring computational physicist who is currently pursuing a Master's degree in high energy experimental particle physics at McGill University. </p> <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in honours physics with distinction from UBC. During my undergraduate degree I completed my thesis with the UBC LIGO group. This worked centered around developing GWSkyNetLite, an extension of the GWSkyNet[1] algorithm designed to separate glitches from genuine gravitational wave events in low-latency settings using rapidly generated skymaps. An additional focus of the work was improving the interpretability of gravitational wave classifiers by researching and implementing methods that probed the patterns and concepts the model used to classify data.</p> <p>Currently, I am working with the ATLAS group at McGill to develop energy reconstruction algorithms for use in ATLAS' liquid argon calorimeter. This work combines digital signal processing and experimental physics to ensure real-time accuracy and resolution is maintained through the LHC's upgrade.</p> <p>Outside of academics, I am deeply passionate about science outreach and communication. As a volunteer with McGill's Physics and Astronomy Outreach program, I have disseminated complex scientific topics to members of the public, making them accessible and exciting for everyone.</p> <p>[1]M.

I trained as a part of the team over the winter and raced during the spring. Being on the team pushed me to my limits and gave me new goals to work toward. As a member of the team I was awarded the Academic Thunderbird Award for maintaining high performance both on and off the competitive field.</p> <p>In 2022 I rode with the Glotmann Simpson cycling group. Additionally, in the summer of 2023 I also purchased my first XC bike.

A link to their website can be found here.</p> <p>Physics Open House</p> <p>I helped set the Rutherford building up for the day and gave tours of the ATLAS lab. This involved informing prospective students and their parents about the scope of the research done as part of the research group, what research looked like and how they could get involved.</p> <p>Family Science Day</p> <p>This was an event targeted at young children (ages 6-10). I was involved in running a demonstration on parachutes wherein I helped children create their own parachute and explained to them a very basic idea of drag and air resistance.

I created this document to help clarify terminology used within my project as there are many different notations and synonymous derivations used to describe these filters. Consider this my blog post about a research concept for PHYS 610</p> </li> <li> <p>Beamforming for Sonar Signals is a project I am working on for my course in digital signal processing (McGill ECSE 512). This project focuses on applying, comparing, and contrasting beamforming techniques, which are essential in enhancing signal directionality and reducing noise interference in sonar systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>GWSkyNetLite: A Gravitational Wave Glitch Classifier Using High Speed Localization Skymaps was my honours thesis (PHYS 449). This project focused on developing a real-time gravitational wave classifier to seperate glitched data from real gravitational wave events. By using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques I developed a convolutional neural network that was able to use low-latency skymaps to classify data in record time. I also investigated the interpretability of the model using various techniques in order to garner trust in the models predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Constraining Cosmic String Parameters Via Gravitational Waves was a project for my course in cosmology (UBC ASTR 403). This project was the creation of a poster documenting how data collected by the LIGO-Virgo array could put limits on early universe formation of cosmic strings. For this project I was awarded 3rd place in the class out of 30 posters.</p> </li> <li> <p>An Investigation into Mercury and Electron Behaviour Via the Franck Hertz Experiment was a project for my upper level experimental labratory (UBC PHYS 409). This project involved recreating the Franck-Hertz experiment which involved accelerating electrons through a thin mercury vapour. By observing the resulting current conclusions were drawn about the quantization of mercury's energy levels. The uncertainties in this experiment were calculated by using a toy Monte-Carlo model.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/FH/FH/","title":"Franck-Hertz Paper","text":""},{"location":"projects/OF/OF/","title":"Optimal Filter Derivation","text":"<p>Here are a couple slides detailing the derivation of the optimal filter.
